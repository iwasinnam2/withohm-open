# Cache trees — branchable exact-replay inventory

Named, isolated exact-replay inventory for withOhm. Complements a data-branching product like Neon (branches Postgres state) without cloning its model — withOhm branches **exact-replay inventory**, not a database.

Parent concept: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)'s Ephemeral Side / Pipeline System split.

## Dual containers

| Ephemeral Side | Pipeline System |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Hot exact-replay inventory (blobs, trees, edge HIT) | Durable money, policy, compliance, trust |
| Fork / reset / promote / freeze | Auth, meters, receipts, audit |

**The idea in one sentence:** other tools branch state, or discount a prefix. withOhm branches exact replay — and the pipeline bills the crossing.

## Key layout

| Tree | Redis key |
|------|-----------|
| Default `main` (no header) | Durable, shared exact-replay inventory |
| Named tree | Isolated per-tree inventory, same digest scheme |

- The digest is always a SHA-256 of the canonicalized request (model + messages + extras) — this is what a receipt's `request_sha256` field refers to.
- Tree id: `[a-z0-9_-]{1,64}`; header `X-Ohm-Cache-Tree` wins over an equivalent body field.
- Unknown / invalid explicit tree -> `400`.
- Exact-match only inside a tree. No semantic cache. No cross-tenant trees.

## Storage honesty (what's actually shipped)

Named-tree blobs use per-tree keys today. **Promote** copies child-local digests into the parent key space — it is not yet a single shared content-addressed object store with reference counting. This is a deliberate distinction worth stating plainly rather than glossing over: **do not expect "zero duplication, one blob many refs"** from the current implementation. A more storage-efficient shared-object design is a named future phase, not shipped, and this doc will keep saying so until it is.

This candor is itself part of the pitch: the goal is a repo that tells you what's true today, not what's aspirational.

## Client surface

- Header: `X-Ohm-Cache-Tree: pr-842` (optional)
- Body: `cache_tree` (optional; header wins)
- Response echo: `X-Ohm-Cache-Tree`

```bash
curl -sS https://api.withohm.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OHM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Ohm-Cache-Tree: pr-842" \
  -d '{"model":"mock","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

See [`demo/cache_tree_demo.sh`](../demo/cache_tree_demo.sh) for a runnable example showing that two named trees stay independent.

## API

| Method | Path | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| `GET` | `/v1/cache/trees` | List trees |
| `POST` | `/v1/cache/trees` | Fork `{name, parent?}` |
| `POST` | `/v1/cache/trees/{id}/reset` | `{to: empty\|parent}` |
| `POST` | `/v1/cache/trees/{id}/promote` | Merge child digests into parent |
| `POST` | `/v1/cache/trees/{id}/freeze` | Immutable tip; further writes reject |

Every fork/reset/promote/freeze (and denied variant) is an audited Pipeline action, same as any other governance operation.

## Non-goals

- Postgres / WAL / schema-branch cosplay — this is not a database product
- Semantic / fuzzy cache, at any tree granularity
- Cross-tenant shared trees

## Compose with a data-branching tool

If you already branch database state per PR (e.g. a preview `DATABASE_URL`), pair it with a same-named cache tree in CI: same job, two headers, two clear nouns (data state vs. exact-replay inventory). This doesn't replace database branching — it's the inventory peer in the same workflow, so preview-branch traffic doesn't silently warm (or pollute) the durable `main` inventory.

```bash
export OHM_TIP="pr-${PR_NUMBER}"

curl -sS https://api.withohm.dev/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OHM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Ohm-Cache-Tree: $OHM_TIP" \
  -d @prompt.json

# on green — promote inventory to main
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.withohm.dev/v1/cache/trees/${OHM_TIP}/promote" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OHM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target":"main"}'
```

## Anti-pattern

Putting every agent/PR job on `main`, then spinning up a second gateway when collisions appear, buys more keys to manage — not isolation. Isolation is a tree problem: keep one gateway, split trees, promote when a tree earns `main`.
